# CellScope
## Overview
<div class="justify-text">
CellScope is an innovative cellular analyzing tool that combines manifold fitting method. Its novel screening of type-related genes (TRG) enhances the accuracy of cell type identification. The subsequent manifold fitting phase is crucial for reducing inherent noise in the dataset, thereby improving clarity and precision for further analysis. The final output of CellScope is a complex dendrogram that not only depicts the hierarchical structure of cell types but also annotates specific differences between cell categories. It highlights the contributing genes responsible for these differences and indicates whether the variations are due to global differences or specific gene expression patterns.

CellScope demonstrates its superior performance compared to existing cell map construction tools, with capabilities including processing large datasets, accurately identifying cell types, and generating visualizations that provide insights into cellular hierarchy. With its innovative approach, CellScope aims to offer researchers a powerful tool to explore and understand the complexity of biological systems at the cellular level.
