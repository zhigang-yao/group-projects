# Overview

The Fixed Boundary Flows Algorithm obtains a discrete flow connecting the fixed boundary points $y_0$ and $y_1$ from the given manifold date in the ambient space. Each point of the flow moves along the direction of the local vector field, which is determined by the scale parameter $h$.

An implementation in R is available on Github: :material-arrow-right: <a href="https://github.com/zhigang-yao/fixed-boundary-flows/" class="btn-href">:simple-github:</a>
