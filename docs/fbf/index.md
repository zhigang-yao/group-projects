# Overview
<div class="justify-text">
We consider fixed boundary flows with canonical interpretability as principal components extended on non-linear Riemannian manifolds. We aim to find a flow with fixed starting and ending points for noisy multivariate data sets lying near an embedded non-linear Riemannian manifold. In geometric terms, the fixed boundary flow is defined as an optimal curve that moves in the data cloud with two fixed end points. At any point on the flow, we maximize the inner product of the vector field, which is calculated locally, and the tangent vector of the flow. The rigorous definition is derived from an optimization problem using the intrinsic metric on the manifolds.
